# Custom Commands
This repository contains quite a few Python files, which are supposed to be ran as command in the console and do some usefull stuff.

## Run the files as console commands
To be able to type a one of the files's names in the console and through this run that corresponding file, you have to do a few things:<br>

## What each file (command) does

### _.py
Run with command:
```bash
_
```
This is a better version of the `cls` or `clear` command, to clear your console. The command `_` is:<br>
a) faster to type and
b) the command also resets all the console formats.

### lib-publish.py
Run with command:
```bash
lib-publish
```
This is just a single command, which runs the two requiered commands, to package and directly upload your own Python library to [PyPi](https://pypi.org/)
