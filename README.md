# Python Projects and Libraries
This repository contains various Python projects, libraries, and experiments I've worked on. It serves as a collection of my Python-related work and learning experiences.

## Libraries

### XulbuX
`XulbuX` is a custom Python library with a lot of small, but really useful types and functions.
For more information, see the [XulbuX README](./Libraries/XulbuX/README.md).

## Projects

### Commands
Inside `Commands` are a lot of Python files, which can be added to the system paths, to be ran as commands.


## Experiments

### SendToFriend
These are **harmless** prank scripts (also as [executables](./Experiments/SendToFriend/executables)), that do all sorts of annoying things.
Every script or executable has a exact description of what it does in the [`README.md`](./Experiments/SendToFriend/README.md), inside the corresponding repo.
> [!CAUTION]
> These scripts lead to actions on your PC that you may not want.
> However, it is important to note that **none of these scripts will cause damage to your PC**.
