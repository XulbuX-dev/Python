# x-convert
The goal of this file is to run it as a command in the console.

You can first run it normally and it will prompt you to create files and a few other things. Say `Yes` to all of them.
After that you should be able to execute the command `x-convert` in the console.

The program is used to convert one type of code into another type of code. Currently, it supports the following conversions:
* `Laravel Blade` to `Vue.js`

To see exactly how this command works and what types of conversions are currently supported, run the command with the `-h` or `--help` option:
```console
x-convert --help
```
