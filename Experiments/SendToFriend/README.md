This script/exe will shut down your PC five seconds after being run and display a shutdown message:<br>
`WARNING: Virus detected. Starting system clean up process...`<br>

## addShutdownScriptToStartupFolderAndShutdownPC | [view script](./scripts/addShutdownScriptToStartupFolderAndShutdownPC.py)
This script/exe will first create a second file `notSUS` in the user's startup directory.<br>
After that, it will start PC shutdown in `{time}` minutes display a message: `PC is shutting down in {time} minutes.`<br>
The `notSUS` file does the exact same thing (shutdown PC after `{time}` minutes and display message).<br>
Per default, the **`{time}` before shutdown is set to `5 minutes`**

## makeLotsOfColorfulRectanglesWithRandomMessages | [view script](./scripts/makeLotsOfColorfulRectanglesWithRandomMessages.pyw)

## notClosableTimedMathsProblemsUntilCorrectAnswer | [view script](./scripts/notClosableTimedMathsProblemsUntilCorrectAnswer.pyw)
This script/exe will create a small window with a math problem and a timer.<br>
If you enter the wrong answer or the timer runs out, the window will renew the problem and open a second math-problem-window.<br>
Trying to close or iconify the window will not work. The only way to close a math-problem-window is by entering the correct answer in time.
